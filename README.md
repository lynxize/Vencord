Some random userplugins for [Vencord](https://github.com/Vendicated/Vencord/) (maybe)

see `src/userplugins`


### Plugins

`src/userplugins/pk4v` - [PluralKit](https://pluralkit.me/) integration for Vencord, inspired by [PluralChum](https://github.com/estroBiologist/pluralchum) and [this earlier Vencord plugin](https://github.com/Vendicated/Vencord/pull/2536/)
