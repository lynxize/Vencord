Some random unofficial plugins for [Vencord](https://github.com/Vendicated/Vencord/).

See `src/userplugins` for the plugins themselves; the rest of this repo is just Vencord with some very minor tweaks.

Installation instructions can be found [here](https://github.com/Vendicated/Vencord/blob/main/docs/1_INSTALLING.md) and [here](https://github.com/Vendicated/Vencord/blob/main/docs/2_PLUGINS.md).

> [!NOTE]
> I don't recommend cloning Vencord from this repo, as I probably won't keep it super up to date

## Plugins

### pk4v

[PluralKit](https://pluralkit.me/) integration, inspired by [PluralChum](https://github.com/estroBiologist/pluralchum) and [this earlier Vencord plugin](https://github.com/Vendicated/Vencord/pull/2536/).

Adds an "edit message" button to proxied messages, allowing them to be edited as if they were normal discord messages. Optionally allows coloring of member names in chat by either member color, system color, or highest account role color.

(see [the plugin itself](src/userplugins/pk4v/index.tsx) for known issues and more information)

### More soon?
